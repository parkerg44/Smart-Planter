# Smart-Planter
A personal project I created as a WSU graduation gift. The planter uses a capacitive soil sensor which measures the moisture of the soil. Depending on the plant, the levels of proper soil moisture will vary. The levels will have to be changed and added to depending on your preferences and plant parameters.  The output of the moisture level will be sent and displayed to an LCD screen. In the code I have written the there are three values, each of which has an accompanying plant pixel picture which is presented on the display. 

The project required a planter pot which I designed and 3D printed. The file for the planter can be found under planter file. 

This project also required a small amount of soldering although if I were to build this project again I would recommend creating a PCB as soldering by hand without a PCB created a mess of wires and components. 

Here is a video of the final project:
