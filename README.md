# Smart-Planter
I created this personal project as a WSU graduation gift for a friend. The Smart Planter uses a capacitive soil sensor that measures the moisture of the soil. Depending on the plant, the levels of proper soil moisture will vary. The soil moisture levels can be changed depending on your preferences and plant parameters.  The output of the moisture level is calculated  and displayed on a LCD screen. The code identifies three values, each having an accompanying plant pixel picture that appears on the display. 

The project required a planter pot which I designed and 3D printed. The planter can be found under Smart Planter Fusion for an autodesk 360 verison, and under Smart Planter for the .stl verison. 

This project also required a small amount of soldering although if I were to build this project again I would recommend creating a PCB as soldering by hand without a PCB created a mess of wires and components. 

Here is a video of the final project:
